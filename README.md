# Shopping-Cart Project

Original Project Description:

## Installation

TODO: Installation Instructions

## Usage

Run the Shopping Cart Script

``` py
python shopping_cart.py
```

## Further - CVS

I worked at CVS all through high school and thought it was hilarious how they always printed a coupon for everything you just bought. I wrote a code that generates a random discount for each product listed, followed by an expiration date 10 days from now in a more legible month-date-year format
